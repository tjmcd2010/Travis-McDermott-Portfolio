# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
## Steps I took to complete this project

1. I created a repository titled "mcdermott-challenge-02" with a README file.
2. I cloned the repository to my local machine and started to build out my html and css files and linked them together in the html.
3. I created my header with my title and avatar.
4. I created a navigation bar in the header.
5. I created the body to include projects that I've been working on. These include shaded, rounded boxes with images utilizing shadow-box and border-radius attributes in the css file.
6. The images for projects that I've completed include a link to url of the completed project.
7. The first project listed has an image that is larger than the others. 
8. I created a footer with a navigation bar of links to ways to connect with me.
9. In the header navigation bar, I connected the links to the appropriate sections of the page. 
10. I created the page in a responsive manner so that the images move, based on the size of the browser that's viewing it. 
11. I utilized various snippets of code that we've used in previous activities to piece together the content for this portfolio.
